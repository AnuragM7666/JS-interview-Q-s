//Hoisting is a behaviour where variable(or functions/ classes) declarations are moved('hoisted') to top of their scope
// during code execution

console.log(a);
var a = 20;
//here var 'a' is declared but not defined, so output shows undefined

//console.log(b)  here the output will show 'b' is not defined as it is not declared as well
